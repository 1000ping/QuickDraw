# [PYTHON] QuickDraw

## Introduction

Here is my python source code for QuickDraw - an online game developed by google. with my code, you could: 
* **Run an app which you could draw in front of a camera (If you use laptop, your webcam will be used by default)**
* **Run an app which you could draw on a canvas**

## Camera app
Below is the demo by running the sript **camera_app.py**:
